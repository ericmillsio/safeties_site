        <p>AI deepfakes have caused significant losses, notably fake kidnappings and even a $25 million scam, by
            impersonating individuals via
            text, email, voice and video. To combat this, SafeTies introduces rotating safe words, similar to Google
            Authenticator,
            to secure conversations against AI spoofing scams.</p>
        <p>SafeTies enhances the security of your personal and professional conversations by introducing a second layer
            of
            verification. This means, alongside recognizing voice, video and text chats, you'll also confirm identities
            through a dynamically generated safe word, accessible via the SafeTies app on your phone.</p>
